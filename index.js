// TODO implement logic

// "Pico y Placa" predictor.
// The inputs should be
// - a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit)
// - a date (as a String)
// - a time
// the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road.

// Note: To develop this application you need to consider the past rules of the Pico&Placa.
// (Hours: 7:00am - 9:30am / 16:00pm - 19:30).
// Additional research would be needed to complete the exercise. â€‹
